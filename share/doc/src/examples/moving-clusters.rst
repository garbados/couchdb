Data that Moves: Switching Clusters
===================================

We host data all over the world so you can be close to your users wherever they are. Unless you're a dedicated customer, your data is stored on one of eight clusters around the globe. You can change that cluster at your leisure to be closer to your users. Here's `how to switch clusters <https://vines.s3.amazonaws.com/r/videos/1F483789-7ACC-46F9-BFB6-8B7204E9153B-6906-0000046D7E4D233E_1d159dce7d2.1.3.mp4?versionId=AD_dmNvZ.5zq7h3TLeraL2dvoxn5t6MA>`_, in six seconds.

Or, if you prefer written directions, here they are:

* Log into Cloudant and go to your dashboard.
* Click `Account`.
* Under `Placement`, you'll see a dropdown of clusters and their locations.
* Select one, and click `Submit`.

That's it! One of our database elves will move your data shortly, no downtime involved.
